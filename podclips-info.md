### Stop wasting money and time
Most podcasters are stuck with their growth. You have the content, but you need to get it out there.

- **$2,000+/month** — Paying agencies for basic clips and you still choosing the moments.
- **10+ hours/week** — Manually editing clips for hours.
- **Lost audience** — The opportunity cost of not posting more content out of the episodes.

While you're stuck editing, other podcasters are posting **15+ shorts** and **3+ clips** per episode and growing **10x faster**.
